                  Becoming-woman is a perpetual process rather than static and absolute.  Becoming-woman has nothing to do with a person's pattern of growth and development in a linear manner.  On the other hand, becoming-woman relates to the situation of the body undergoing a creative process and finding new functions.  Becoming-woman is not about the point where it starts or ends, but rather emerges in the middle of a process.</p>

                  Soping San Laura is a quasi-fiction exploration of Riskya Duavania in collaboration with Mimzy about flea market as a safe space for transwomen in a heteronormative society that still considers it taboo.  This series of works uses the interpretation of the idea “Becoming” by Deleuze and Guattari, about the concept of Becoming-woman that’s outside of a woman's genetic body. Soping San Laura was built on the imagination of the actual place, Pasar Loak Soping, a shopping district for secondhand collection located in the centre of Salatiga City, Indonesia.  Cik San, a transwoman who also sells there, will display her wares and become the main subject in Soping San Laura. Through the medium of television, Cik San will narrate her story on her quest to find her gender identity in <strong>door-to-door</strong> series where she perceived her body only as a mode of production, then in <strong>Soping Mursida</strong> when her body went through the process of becoming-woman, and lastly where she found the borderline of living in two realms namely Laura (in Javanese, Lanang ora Wedok Ora, meaning not male, not female) in <strong>Becoming-Imperceptible</strong>.  In addition, an assessment of the fictitious world is built through a series of posters by Mimzy as well as tactile explorations on the visual materials created in the city of Salatiga.

                  Soping San Laura exhibited for the first time at Taman Budaya Yogyakarta as the final result of the Asana Bina Seni education program organized by the Yayasan Biennale Yogyakarta. Due to the pandemic situation, Soping San Laura is currently closed, so it happened to be online. Through this website, Soping San Laura attempts to explore the flea market experience although it will not be able to convey the same feeling. On the contrary, this site can be a reflection for the audience while “casting a spell” for a more inclusive world and wishing for the pandemic to get better.

                  Mimzy (They/She) is a Trans* Non Binary who currently works in the creative media field, especially in processing graphics. Previously, she worked as an in-house content creative designer for a clothing brand in Yogyakarta. Besides working, Mimzy fills her free time by participating in street library activities, discussions, and painting as a form of self-actualization.  In early 2020, the "Aksara" zine became the initial project to compose and design a zine for the street library collective in Taman Suropati, Jakarta.  The Zine Aksara contains a combination of writings and images drawn from the concerns of street library comrades, as well as several archives of people's direct action activities to help the people face the crisis.

                  Her passion for drawing fanart and fiddling with graphic media on computers since elementary school has brought her to the work of graphic design as her creative process. This year, with Riskya Duavania she will present “Soping San Laura” which tells the story of Cik San and Mimzy's sisterhood experiences at the flea market.  Cik San through a collection of used goods produces creative creations as a transwoman in the community.  The images and actualizations in this series of works contain hope for a more inclusive world, especially for transwomen.

                  Riskya Duavania (she/her) is a film student who loves to work with documentary approaches for her artistic practices. She has always been interested in the collection of objects as a medium to discuss the broader context of an issue, such as collective memory and the spectrum of gender identity. New media is her platform for advocacy and form of expression to articulate the issues.

                  Collective memories regarding the momentum of “Rejecting Omnibus Law: Job’s Creation Law” protest where the post-protest remained wastes on the street and the audio-visual documentation were thus being archived in “The Imminent Commonplace” (in collaboration with Carkultera Wage Sae).  A demonstration of smart CCTV technology from an online shop was presented in her latest artwork series entitled "Panoptik Anti Maling (Anti-Theft Panoptic)". Her upcoming work entitled “Soping San Laura” will display a series of artworks made from secondhand collections that tells the story of a transwoman at a flea market finding her gender identity, namely Cik San.  In this series of works, she collaborates with Mimzy, a graphic designer, to imagine a world that is inclusive of transwomen.
